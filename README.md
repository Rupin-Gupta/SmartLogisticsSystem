##  Project Overview

The Smart Logistics Decision System aims to optimize delivery operations using data-driven decision making. The system integrates operational data, environmental factors, and predictive modeling to improve route efficiency, delivery time estimation, and cost optimization.

##  Project Objectives

### 1️ Risk-Based Delay Prediction
- Build a machine learning model that predicts delivery delay probability.
- Interpret model output probability as a structured **risk score**.

### 2️ Risk Tier Classification
Convert predicted delay probability into operational risk levels:

| Probability Range | Risk Level |
|-------------------|------------|
| < 0.40            | Low Risk   |
| 0.40 – 0.70       | Medium Risk|
| > 0.70            | High Risk  |
| > 0.85            | Critical Risk |

### 3️ Rule-Based Risk Overrides
Enhance ML predictions with domain-driven business logic:

- **Weather-Traffic Critical Rule:**  
  If Precipitation > 20mm AND Traffic = Heavy → Risk = Critical

- **Asset Stress Rule:**  
  If Asset_Utilization > 90% → Operational Risk = High

### 4️ Risk-Driven Decision Engine
Attach automated actions based on risk level:

-  Low Risk → Normal delivery  
-  Medium Risk → Monitoring + slight route optimization  
-  High Risk → Re-route vehicle + notify operations  
-  Critical Risk → Immediate rerouting + AI-generated client notification + fleet redistribution  

### 5️ Simulated Optimization Logic
- Simulate route optimization by adjusting estimated delivery time.
- Simulate fleet redistribution when asset utilization exceeds safe thresholds.

### 6️ AI Communication Layer
Automatically generate customer notifications when risk is High or Critical.


##  Dataset

**Base Dataset:**  
Smart Logistics Supply Chain Dataset 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/smart-logistics-supply-chain-dataset

The original dataset contains shipment details, delivery timelines, geographic information, and operational attributes.

### Feature Engineering

A precipitation factor was added to the dataset using quantile-based binning to simulate weather impact on logistics performance. This allows the system to incorporate environmental conditions into delivery time and decision modeling.

---

##  Phase 3 – Risk Classification & Decision Layer

###  Objective
Transform predicted delay probabilities into structured operational risk levels and integrate business rule overrides to create a robust decision engine.

---

###  Architecture Overview

Phase 3 converts:

Model Output → Risk Tier → Rule Overrides → Final Risk Level

Pipeline:

1. `delay_probability` (from Phase 2 model)
2. Probability-to-risk mapping
3. Rule-based escalation
4. Final operational risk classification

This creates a hybrid ML + domain-intelligence system.

---

###  Step 3.1 – Probability → Risk Mapping

Delay probability is converted into structured risk tiers:

- `< 0.40` → Low  
- `0.40 – 0.70` → Medium  
- `> 0.70` → High  
- `> 0.90` → Critical  

Implemented via:

`get_risk_level(probability)`

Generated column:

`ml_risk_level`

This ensures model output becomes actionable.

---

###  Step 3.2 – Rule-Based Risk Overrides

To enhance robustness, business logic rules were introduced.

#### Rule 1 – Weather-Traffic Escalation
If:
- Precipitation (mm) > 15  
- Traffic_Status_Heavy == 1  

→ Risk escalated to **Critical**

#### Rule 2 – Asset Stress Escalation
If:
- Asset_Utilization > 90  

→ Risk escalated to **High**

Final risk level is determined as the maximum severity between:

- ML-derived risk  
- Rule-based escalation  

Generated column:

`final_risk_level`

---

###  Why Combine ML + Rule Logic?

Pure ML models may miss rare but operationally dangerous scenarios.

By integrating domain rules:

- Critical weather conditions are never ignored  
- Fleet stress is proactively managed  
- Operational safety is prioritized  
- Decision robustness increases  

This design reflects real-world logistics intelligence systems.

---

###  Output

Generated:

`data/processed/dataset_with_risk_levels.csv`

Risk distribution example:

- Medium ≈ 32%  
- High ≈ 24%
- Critical ≈ 24%  
- Low ≈ 20%

Phase 3 completes the structured risk engine of the Smart Logistics Decision System.

---

## Phase 4 – Risk-Driven Decision Engine
## Objective

Translate structured risk into operational logistics actions using mathematically grounded ETA modeling.

Risk → Action Mapping

Low → A_Normal

Medium → B_Monitor

High → C_Reroute_Notify

Critical → D_Reroute_Notify_Redistribute

High + Utilization > 90 → Escalated to redistribution

Dynamic Baseline ETA

Operational base time:

operational_base_time = mean(Waiting_Time)


Traffic impact:

traffic_impact(level) = mean(delay_probability | traffic_level = level)


## Baseline ETA:

baseline_eta = operational_base_time × (1 + traffic_delay_factor)


ETA is fully data-driven and not heuristically assigned.

Simulated Route Optimization

## Improvement logic:

optimized_factor =
original_factor − 0.5 × (original_factor − clear_factor)


## Optimized ETA:

optimized_eta =
operational_base_time + (optimized_factor × operational_base_time)


## Guarantee:

clear_factor < optimized_factor < original_factor


No arbitrary time reductions are applied.

## Utilization Impact Analysis

## Utilization buckets:

(0–70]

(70–90]

(90–100]

## Stress gap:

stress_gap = high_util_factor − medium_util_factor


Redistribution occurs only if stress_gap exceeds threshold.

Notification Layer (Planned Enhancement)

When action includes "Notify":

Structured message generated

Context-aware (traffic, utilization, risk level)

This completes the operational decision layer.

## Phase 5 – Production Deployment & Mathematical Decision Engine

Phase 5 transitions the system into a modular, production-ready architecture.

## Modular Decision Engine

Implemented in decision_engine.py:

classify_risk()

get_action()

calculate_baseline_eta()

calculate_optimized_eta()

generate_notification()

All logic is dataset-driven and deterministic.

## Mathematical ETA Computation

## Baseline ETA:

baseline_eta = operational_base_time × (1 + traffic_delay_factor)


## Optimization factor:

optimized_factor =
original_factor − 0.5 × (original_factor − clear_factor)


## Optimized ETA:

optimized_eta =
operational_base_time + (optimized_factor × operational_base_time)


All optimization is mathematically bounded and consistent.

Utilization Validation
utilization_impact =
mean(delay_probability | utilization_bucket)

stress_gap =
high_util_factor − medium_util_factor


Redistribution skipped if:

stress_gap < threshold

## AI-Based Customer Notification

## Dynamic communication based on:

Risk level

Traffic condition

Baseline ETA

Optimized ETA

If optimized ETA improves delivery time, message reflects improvement.
Otherwise, message reflects monitoring state.

## Streamlit Deployment

Implemented app.py for real-time inference.

Deployment features:

Integrated trained model and scaler

Used scaler.feature_names_in_ to ensure feature alignment

Auto-filled missing inputs using dataset statistics

Eliminated feature mismatch issues

## Frontend displays:

Phase 6 – Financial Intelligence & Batch Shipment Analytics (New)
Objective

Extend the Smart Logistics Decision System beyond operational prediction into financial exposure modeling and portfolio-level shipment intelligence.

This phase enhances the system with:

Financial impact modeling

Priority-based shipment ranking

Batch shipment intelligence mode

Premium executive dashboard interface

6.1 Financial Impact Engine

To translate operational delay risk into economic exposure, a financial modeling layer was introduced.

For each shipment:

expected_loss = delay_probability × total_delay_cost


Where total delay cost may include:

SLA penalty (based on delay severity)

Refund risk (probability-weighted)

Additional shipping or reroute cost

Express handling impact

The Streamlit dashboard now displays:

Expected Delay (minutes)

Expected Financial Loss ($)

Financial severity classification

This allows decision-makers to quantify operational risk in monetary terms.

6.2 Priority Scoring Mechanism

To support operational prioritization, a structured ranking metric was introduced:

priority_score = delay_probability × expected_loss


This ensures shipments are ranked not only by risk, but by potential financial impact.

The system can now identify:

Highest exposure shipments

Concentration of High / Critical risks

Portfolio-level financial exposure

This adds a strategic allocation layer to fleet management.

6.3 Batch Shipment Mode

A dual analysis architecture was implemented.

Two Operational Modes:

Single Shipment Analysis

Batch Shipment (CSV Upload)

In Batch Mode, the system:

Accepts structured CSV uploads

Predicts delay probability for each shipment

Classifies risk with rule overrides

Computes baseline and optimized ETA

Estimates financial exposure

Ranks shipments using priority scoring

Allows downloadable analytics results

This transforms the application from a single-inference tool into a logistics portfolio intelligence system.

6.4 Dashboard Upgrade

The Streamlit deployment layer was enhanced

Enhancements include:

Executive Summary panel

Structured KPI layout

ETA comparison visualization

Financial exposure cards

Risk color-coding
